# **Raja-Extended: A Respectful and Legal Extension of the Raja Ray Tracer**

> *"Extending with care, licensing with respect."*

---

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

We extend our deepest gratitude to **Master Paul Bourke** for gifting the world with the **Raja Ray Tracer** — a beautifully crafted, mathematically rigorous, and educationally invaluable ray tracing implementation first released in 2001.

**Raja-Extended** is a modest enhancement of this timeless work, developed **without modifying a single line** of the original code. New features are added exclusively through **new, independent source files**, preserving the integrity and spirit of the original project.

---

## 🎯 Project Philosophy

- **Original code remains untouched**: Every file authored by Paul Bourke is included **exactly as published**, with no alterations whatsoever.  
- **Additive-only approach**: New shapes (e.g., `Cone`, `Torus`), materials (e.g., `Dielectric`), and lights (e.g., `SpotLight`) are implemented in **brand-new files**.  
- **Minimal and respectful growth**: The extension stays true to Raja’s core values: **simplicity, correctness, and clarity**.  
- **Community-first**: Released as free and open-source software to empower learners, educators, and developers worldwide.

## ⚖️ Licensing and Legal Framework

### 1. **Original Raja Code**
- **Author**: Paul Bourke (2001)  
- **License Terms**:  
  > *"Free for non-commercial use. Attribution appreciated."*  
- **Scope**: `Scene.java`, `Renderer.java`, `Ray.java`, and all other original files.  
- **Status**: These files are **unchanged** and distributed under Paul Bourke’s original terms.

### 2. **New Extension Code**
- **Author**: Murat İnan  
- **License**: **GNU General Public License v2.0 (GPLv2)**  
- **Scope**: `Cone.java`, `Torus.java`, `DielectricMaterial.java`, `SpotLight.java`, etc.  
- **Note**: These files are **independently authored** and only interact with the original code through public interfaces (e.g., scene structure).

### 3. **Distribution Model: “Mere Aggregation”**
- This project constitutes a **mere aggregation** of two separately licensed works.  
- The **GPLv2 applies only to new files** and **does not extend** to Paul Bourke’s original code.  
- This approach is **explicitly permitted** by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and aligns with open-source best practices.
